# Changelog - Noor Ahlul Bayt Islamic Browser

All notable changes to the Islamic family-safe browser application are documented in this file.

## [Version 1.2.0] - 2025-07-02

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### **Fixed: Infinite Page Reload Loops**
- **Issue**: Web pages were continuously refreshing in an infinite loop, making the browser unusable
- **Root Cause**: SafeSearch enforcement was happening in `NavigationCompleted` event, causing redirect loops
- **Solution**: 
  - Moved SafeSearch enforcement from `NavigationCompleted` to `NavigateToUrl` method
  - Removed problematic cancel/navigate pattern from `WebViewContentFilterService.OnNavigationStarting`
  - Enhanced loop prevention mechanism with smarter detection
- **Files Changed**:
  - `NoorAhlulBayt.Browser/MainWindow.xaml.cs`
  - `NoorAhlulBayt.Browser/Services/WebViewContentFilterService.cs`

#### **Fixed: Web Page Loading Failures**
- **Issue**: Pages showing "Failed to load the webpage" errors after implementing reload loop fix
- **Root Cause**: Multiple NavigationStarting handlers conflicting and overly aggressive SafeSearch enforcement
- **Solution**:
  - Consolidated SafeSearch enforcement to single location in `NavigateToUrl`
  - Removed duplicate SafeSearch processing from multiple event handlers
  - Fixed navigation cancellation issues that prevented legitimate page loads
- **Files Changed**:
  - `NoorAhlulBayt.Browser/MainWindow.xaml.cs`
  - `NoorAhlulBayt.Browser/Services/WebViewContentFilterService.cs`

#### **Fixed: Visual Corruption During Page Loading**
- **Issue**: Web pages experienced continuous color changes and dimming in infinite loops during loading
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive CSS injection mechanisms were continuously overriding web page styling
- **Solution**: Removed problematic CSS injection that was causing visual corruption
- **Files Changed**:
  - `NoorAhlulBayt.Browser/Services/WebViewContentFilterService.cs`

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### **Enhanced Loop Prevention Mechanism**
- **Before**: Simple 1000ms cooldown that was too restrictive
- **After**: Smart detection allowing up to 5 rapid navigations within 200ms cooldown
- **Benefits**: Prevents infinite loops while allowing legitimate redirects and navigation patterns
- **Implementation**:
  ```csharp
  private const int NAVIGATION_COOLDOWN_MS = 200; // Reduced from 1000ms
  private const int MAX_RAPID_NAVIGATIONS = 5; // New counter-based prevention
  ```

#### **Consolidated SafeSearch Enforcement**
- **Before**: SafeSearch applied in multiple locations causing conflicts:
  - NavigationCompleted event
  - NavigationStarting event  
  - WebResourceRequested event
- **After**: Single point of SafeSearch enforcement in `NavigateToUrl` method
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates duplicate processing
  - Prevents navigation conflicts
  - Ensures consistent SafeSearch application
  - Improves performance

#### **Improved Navigation Event Handling**
- **Before**: Multiple NavigationStarting handlers potentially conflicting
- **After**: Clear separation of concerns:
  - `MainWindow.WebView_NavigationStarting`: UI updates and basic navigation handling
  - `WebViewContentFilterService.OnNavigationStarting`: Content filtering and loop prevention only
- **Benefits**: Eliminates race conditions and navigation conflicts

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Content Filtering

#### **Maintained Islamic Content Filtering**
- ‚úÖ **SafeSearch Enforcement**: Still properly applied to Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo
- ‚úÖ **Domain Blacklisting**: Continues to block inappropriate websites
- ‚úÖ **Ad Blocking**: Web resource filtering still active
- ‚úÖ **Prayer Time Blocking**: Time-based restrictions remain functional
- ‚úÖ **Content Scanning**: Inappropriate content detection still working

#### **Enhanced SafeSearch Logic**
- **Improved Timing**: SafeSearch now applied before navigation starts, not after completion
- **Better URL Handling**: Only modifies search engine URLs, leaves other sites unchanged
- **Reduced Conflicts**: No longer interferes with legitimate website navigation

### üìä Performance Improvements

#### **Reduced Navigation Overhead**
- **Before**: Multiple SafeSearch checks per navigation
- **After**: Single SafeSearch check before navigation starts
- **Result**: Faster page loading and reduced CPU usage

#### **Optimized Event Handling**
- **Before**: Redundant event processing in multiple handlers
- **After**: Streamlined event handling with clear responsibilities
- **Result**: Better browser responsiveness and stability

### üîç Diagnostic Improvements

#### **Enhanced Logging**
- Added detailed navigation event logging for troubleshooting
- Improved error reporting for content filtering operations
- Better tracking of loop prevention mechanisms

### üß™ Testing & Validation

#### **Verified Functionality**
- ‚úÖ **Normal Website Navigation**: Regular websites load properly
- ‚úÖ **Search Engine Usage**: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo work with SafeSearch
- ‚úÖ **Content Filtering**: Inappropriate content still blocked
- ‚úÖ **Islamic Features**: Prayer times, Islamic themes functional
- ‚úÖ **Stability**: No more infinite loops or loading failures

### üìù Code Quality

#### **Improved Code Organization**
- Better separation of concerns between UI and content filtering
- Cleaner event handler responsibilities
- Reduced code duplication
- Enhanced error handling

#### **Documentation Updates**
- Added inline comments explaining SafeSearch enforcement changes
- Documented loop prevention mechanism
- Clarified event handler responsibilities
